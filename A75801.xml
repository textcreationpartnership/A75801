         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here are extant many <hi>Treatiſes and Hiſtories of Trees and Plants,</hi> ſhewing us, the <hi>Kinds, Formes, Natures, and Vertues</hi> of them: ſome likewiſe teach us the manner of <hi>Propagation of Fruit-trees,</hi> their <hi>Sowing, Grafting, Setting, Preſervation, and Ordering:</hi> But moſt of theſe Authors ſpeake in an unknown Tongue to the plaine Engliſh Husbandman, (whoſe encouragement and direction, I ſhall herein much endeavour) Only ſome few ſmall peeces have beene offered to him which he may underſtand, but very much defective in many neceſſary, and principall parts of the Art of Planting Fruit-trees: And not only ſo, but likewiſe (ſome of them) are full of <hi>dangerous and hurtfull inſtructions,</hi> and things notoriouſly untrue, as ſhall particularly appeare in the enſuing diſcourſe. See pag. <hi>78.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that a <hi>plaine, ſound, Experimentall worke upon this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,</hi> hath been much wanting in this Nation.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Art of Planting Fruit-trees</hi> is (among Ancient Authors) called <hi>Husbandry,</hi> being it is one part of the Husbandmans work:<note place="margin">Quid ſit A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gricultura. vid. pag. 6:</note> though in many parts of this Nation Husbandmen have little skill in it, their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour being chiefely Tillage of the ground for Corne. But this is a part of the Husbandmans worke as well as that, yea: and the chiefest, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thieſt part: <hi>Adam in time of his Innocency</hi> was imployed in this part of <hi>Husbandry</hi> about Fruit-trees, as is ſhewed pag. <hi>12.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But when he had ſinned, he was put away from this worke to till the ground, a lower and inferior labour. <hi>Gen 3.23. The Lord God ſent him forth from the Garden of Eden, to till the Ground.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We ſee likewiſe the Scripture calls it <hi>Husbandry, Noah</hi> is called an Husbandman when he planted a <hi>Vineyard Gen. 9.20.</hi> God (bleſſed for ever) is called an Husbandman, for that he pruneth, purgeth, and ordereth his <hi>Myſticall Vine-tree the Church, Ioh. 15.1.</hi> So that I ſhall keep the phraſe throughout the Worke.</p>
            <p>I have ſeene (I ſuppoſe) the beſt Workes, both of Ancient, and Late Writers upon <hi>this Subject,</hi> and have learned from them what I could, for accompliſhment of this Art, and have obſerved the practiſe, &amp; experiments
<pb facs="tcp:130473:6"/> of many from time to time, concerning it, and have improved them to my own advantage.</p>
            <p>And likewiſe I have ſet my ſelfe to the <hi>Practice</hi> of this worke for the ſpace of <hi>Twenty yeares,</hi> and more: endeavouring to find out things of uſe and profit, by <hi>Practiſe and Experience,</hi> that I might ſpeake upon better and ſurer grounds, then ſome others who have written upon this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, for <hi>Experience</hi> guides, and informes <hi>Reaſon</hi> in many things, in which (without <hi>Experience</hi>) it would often erre. Some who have taught this <hi>Art of Planting Fruit-trees,</hi> have beene in it (I conceive) only <hi>Contemplative men,</hi> having little, or no <hi>Experience</hi> in it: ſo that in many things they have erred, and that groſſely, as ſhall appeare in due place.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">L. Ba. Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc. Lear.</note>A Learned Author ſaies, <hi>The writings of ſpeculative men upon active matter (for the moſt part) ſeemes to men of experience to be but as dreames and dotage: And that it were to be wiſhed (as that which would make Learning indeed ſolid and fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full) that Active men would or could become Writers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Study, and Practiſe</hi> (by degrees) frame new Arts, and adde to the old:
<q>
                  <note place="margin">Virg. Geor.</note>Per varios uſus Meditando extunderet Artes: paulatim.</q> 
               <hi>Experience</hi> is called <hi>the Perfecter of Arts, and the moſt ſure, and beſt teacher in any Art, Contemplation and Action</hi> are the <hi>two Leggs</hi> whereon Arts runne ſtedily and ſtrongly, and the one without the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, can but hop, or goe lamely: They are the two <hi>Eyes</hi> wherewith men ſee natures ſecrets clearely, but the one alone diſcernes but dimly: And hence it followes that ſome who were only contemplators of nature without experience, and would needs adventure to write, &amp; give inſtructions touching the <hi>Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctique part</hi> of this Art of <hi>Planting Fruit-trees,</hi> have in many things (as the aforeſaid Author ſaies) preſented us with <hi>ſmoake</hi> inſteed of the <hi>lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide flames of light:</hi> They have indeed ſhewed us a comely and beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full body, painted according to Art, but yet liveleſse and without a ſpirit, And have offered us <hi>ſhells and huskes</hi> inſtead of <hi>kernells.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But now, <hi>ſpeculation and Action,</hi> are as <hi>Soule and Body</hi> uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, which labouring togeather, worke out both <hi>Profit and Pleaſure:</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny advantages to our ſelves and others. When <hi>Speculation and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe, Art and Nature,</hi> are matched together, they are pregnant and fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, but the one alone, wanting a meete helper, what fruits can it bring forth: <hi>Experience</hi> (as a Philoſopher ſaies) is the <hi>Root of Art:</hi> and it may well be ſo called, from whence ſprings a numerous multitude of new
<pb facs="tcp:130473:6"/> Experiments: for from <hi>one Root, or ſingle Experiment,</hi> (though per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps a poore and meane one in it ſelfe) if throughly weighed with Reaſon and judgement, may ariſe many rich and rare inventions: And it's moſt true, which the <hi>Lord Bacon</hi> ſaies to this purpoſe: <hi>As through a ſmall hole, or cranny, a man may ſee great Objects, ſo through ſmall and contemptible inſtances, men may ſee great Axioms, ſingular ſecrets of nature.</hi> Men will <hi>labour hard,</hi> and <hi>a long time</hi> in ſome labours full of <hi>hazard and danger,</hi> and perhaps <hi>unjuſt</hi> too, and all for <hi>a little profit:</hi> but here, in this employment, men may with <hi>a little la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,</hi> in a <hi>ſhort time,</hi> without <hi>hazard or danger,</hi> and that <hi>juſtly,</hi> obtaine <hi>great, and many profits,</hi> and thoſe with <hi>Pleaſures</hi> ſuperadded.</p>
            <p>Workes, and labours, which have in them but a vaine, and <hi>unprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble pleaſure,</hi> are approved but only of ſome ſenſuall perſons, And ſuch la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours as have but only <hi>Profit,</hi> and doe not eaſe the paines with ſome <hi>Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantneſſe</hi> in them, are yet harſh, and diſliked of many, but ſuch as yeeld both <hi>Profit and Pleaſure,</hi> are univerſally liked &amp; allowed of all, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the <hi>Poet.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>Omne tulit punctum, qui miſcuit utile dulci.</q>
            <p>Either of theſe is the better, becauſe of the other joyned with it, when they runne along, hand in hand, the <hi>Profit</hi> is the more, becauſe of the <hi>Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,</hi> and the <hi>Pleaſure</hi> is more, becauſe of the <hi>Profit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now therefore: That men may obtaine yearely a plentifull harveſt of <hi>Profits and Pleaſures,</hi> I have endeavoured to remove whatſoever might hinder, and have laid downe ſome Arguments of encouragement to ſet upon, and proſecute the means to obtaine them, diſcovering the beſt way I can find out, how they may be gotten with moſt ſpeede, and kept with moſt ſecurity.</p>
            <p>If any man think the <hi>Divine,</hi> and <hi>Humane Arguments</hi> (preceding the worke) to be needleſſe, becauſe generally men know, that Planting Friut-trees is a very profitable worke, none doubt it.</p>
            <p>I Anſwer, Some know it by experience many others doe not.</p>
            <p>And although men are convinced of the profitablenes of the worke, yet there is need of ſome quickning <hi>Motives</hi> to it; And I know none more pervalent then thoſe taken from <hi>Profites,</hi> and <hi>Pleaſures;</hi> conſidered in ſo great and ſo many reſpects: eſpetially if we take in the <hi>Spiritual part,</hi> unto which the <hi>Arguments</hi> may be as properly referred, as to the <hi>Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Or if any accompt the Arguments too large, conceiving the <hi>Porch</hi> to be too big for the <hi>Houſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is Anſwered: ſuch a Judgment ariſes from a miſtake, for the whole
<pb facs="tcp:130473:7"/> Worke (following the Arguments conſidered together, both the <hi>Naturall, and Spirituall part,</hi> is but one entire <hi>Treatiſe,</hi> as in the Title-Page is exprest: And beſides; the worke (as yet) is not finiſhed, There is (it may be) as much behind, which in time I hope will be perfited. Accept of what is made ready at preſent, which as it may be profitable to ſome in reſpect of Encouragments and Directions in the practiſe of the Worke, ſo alſo I deſire it may be a meanes to ſtir up others to doe ſome thing in the like kind for <hi>Publique Profit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are many good wits exerciſed about Toyes, and Trifles: ſome men beſtow exceſſive <hi>Time, coſt, and Labour,</hi> about meere ſhadowes, and well deſerve <hi>Marſhalls Motto,</hi>
               <q>
                  <l>Turpis eſt difficiles habere nugas.</l>
                  <l>Et ſtultus labor eſt ineptiarum.<note place="margin">

            </p>
            <p>While they might in the mean time, by the ſtudy and practiſe of this art, (in ſearching out many hidden <hi>ſecrets of nature and experiments</hi>) much advantage themselves, and many others, both in reſpect of <hi>Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralls, and Spiritualls.</hi> An ancient Author ſaies, <hi>Not he that knoweth many things, but he that knoweth things Fruitfull is Wiſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This <hi>Art</hi> is a full store-Houſe, out of which may be brought both <hi>Meat, Drink, and Mony,</hi> it is a rich <hi>Myne,</hi> without bounds or bottom, out of which we may digg <hi>Profits and Pleaſures</hi> great, and many, and worthy the ſtudy, and labour of the moſt wiſe and Learned.</p>
            <p>The good of this Imployment, both in the <hi>Theorique, and Practique part,</hi> ſpreads it ſelfe <hi>over all places in the World, to all perſons in the world, from the Cradle to the Grave, from the beginning of the World, to the end of it;</hi> ſo that no worke can be more <hi>univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally good</hi> than this.</p>
            <p>Now therefore ſeeing there is ſo much profit, and advantage to be received from this imployment of <hi>Planting Fruit-trees</hi> both in <hi>Temporall,</hi> and <hi>Spirituall</hi> reſpects, Let us ſet about it, and labour in it, either with <hi>Body or mind,</hi> or both, That thereby the <hi>Glory of God,</hi> and <hi>Publique Profit</hi> (together with our owne advantages) may be promoted.</p>
            <p>The bleſſing of God goe a long with us, and give the increaſe in all our labours, and proſper the workes of our hands.</p>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:130473:15"/> Graſſe,</hi> (although the common prejudice againſt <hi>Fruit-trees in feilds</hi> is, that they ſpoyle Graſſe) as that ſome Land not being worth above 10<hi rend="sup">s</hi>, or 13<hi rend="sup">s</hi> 4<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. an <hi>Acre,</hi> the Graſſe (<hi>by planting Fruit trees</hi> regularly upon it) was afterwards worth 30<hi rend="sup">s</hi>, or 40<hi rend="sup">s</hi>, or 50<hi rend="sup">s</hi> an <hi>Acre,</hi> And the <hi>Fruits</hi> upon the Trees may yeild ſome 3<hi rend="sup">l</hi>, ſome 5<hi rend="sup">l</hi>, Or ſome 6 <hi>or</hi> 8<hi rend="sup">l</hi> 
               <hi>an Acre; See Pag.</hi> 262. of his Book.</p>
            <p>And that in <hi>Kent, Eſſex, Surrey, Middleſex,</hi> and thoſe parts, ſome Land that was not worth above 6 or 8<hi rend="sup">s</hi> 
               <hi>the Acre,</hi> was by <hi>Nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries of young Trees, planting, and ordering of them,</hi> in certaine years brought to be worth 20<hi rend="sup">l</hi> 
               <hi>an Acre,</hi> and ſome 40 or more.</p>
            <p>And further, he affirmeth, that ſome <hi>Orchards</hi> in thoſe parts are worth to graſe <hi>Forty, or fifty ſhillings or</hi> 3<hi rend="sup">l</hi> 
               <hi>an Acre,</hi> and are ſo let to Tenants: And the <hi>fruits</hi> of thoſe Trees ſeldome yeild ſo little, as <hi>Double or treble the worth of the Graſſe,</hi> many times <hi>five or ſix fold,</hi> or more, <hi>ſee Pag.</hi> 263. of his Book.</p>
            <p>It may (perhaps) be objected: That Fruit-trees ſo planted make graſſe (under, and about them) ſower, that it is not ſo plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant, and good for Cattle, as ſome other, where no Trees are.</p>
            <p>It is Anſwered: Although it be not ſo pleaſant altogether, as that where ther's no ſhade of trees, yet other advantages doe more then make amends. Its obſerv'd that <hi>ſuch Graſſe is earlier in the ſpring</hi> then upon other grounds, and that ſuch grounds beare <hi>more,</hi> when its cut for hay, or if paſtured it keeps <hi>more Cattle,</hi> then Lands of like quantity not ſo planted: And beſides, in a <hi>hot and dry ſummer,</hi> ther's graſſe under, and about Trees, when its burnt up in other grounds.</p>
            <p>My advice is therefore (all theſe <hi>Profits and advantages</hi> conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered) that men ſet themſelves diligently to this work of <hi>Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Fruit-trees,</hi> for improvement of their Lands and Eſtates. Not only, that they plant good <hi>Orchards and Gardens,</hi> but alſo that they <hi>Plant round about their feilds, and in their Corne, Paſture, and hay grounds,</hi> the fruit-trees at a large diſtance one from another 20 yards aſunder, and that they ſuffer no branches to ſpread, within two yards from the ground, that ſo they may be out of the reach of Cattle, and may not be troubleſome to workmen <hi>in plowing, ſowing, reaping,</hi> and other works.</p>
            <p>If the Plants are faire ſtraight ones, of <hi>two yards high,</hi> or there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:130473:15"/> &amp; fenced about to preſerve them from Cattle at the firſt, (with ſome ſtakes or the like) they will in a few years preſerve themſelves, and will need but little labour about them after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards as long as they live.</p>
            <p>And hereby men may reape <hi>every yeare two harveſts, (from one, and the ſame peece of land)</hi> the one of <hi>Corne,</hi> the other of <hi>fruits of trees,</hi> and the latter (when trees are growne larg,) (probably) will be the greater.</p>
            <p>And in this reſpect this way of <hi>improvement of Lands,</hi> is much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then other wayes of profit; becauſe in getting <hi>Corne,</hi> or rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing profits by any other wayes of improvement, men muſt of neceſſity, beſtow much <hi>mony, time, and paines</hi> about them, every yeare, which eats up a great part of their profits, but in <hi>Planting fruit-trees,</hi> the worſt is at firſt, after a few years, they yeild great profits, with little coſt and labour. So that as was ſaid <hi>fruit-trees in a few years, with ſmall coſt, and labour; will double, and treble, the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue of Lands,</hi> and after many years, the advance of Profit will be <hi>manyfold.</hi>

            <p>And let us ſay what we will, or can, ther's many that have Lands which they might Plant, and improve to an exceeding great value, who will yet be idle, and ſlothfull, and object with Solomons ſluggard <hi>ther's a Lyon in the way,</hi> ſomething, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that hinders: yet theſe men when they ſee fruits, will be as eager for them as any others, and therefore willbe very good Chapmen, to buy the Fruits of the diligent huſbandman.</p>

                  </label> To this I Anſwere: That if there were no remedy, againſt this miſcheife, it might indeed be a juſt diſcouragement: but this fear may be removed diverſe wayes.</p>
               <p>And I adviſe, having made a good fence about the Orchard, keep therein a luſty Maſtiffe or two; that will not be charmed in the night time, and the terror of them would keep moſt from adventuring upon ſuch an Occaſion,</p>
               <p>Secondly: ſome that have good Orchards watch their fruits. If a man keep 2, or 3, or more ſervants, they may watch in their turns,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:130473:16"/> its no great matter, if you conſider for what time only it is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, which is but from the time that fruits come to be worth get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, till they be ripe: and that's not long: And conſider: it is in a pleaſant ſeaſon of the yeare, the paines and charge would be but little to the profit: we ſee men are vigilant and diligent much more then this would require upon farr leſſe advantages.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But there is a third means to keep Orchards from being rob'd, which I eſteeme beſt of any other, It is this: I would have every man (that hath land) to plant ſome fruit-trees for himſelfe, that ſo they may not be theeves to their neighbours: and let thoſe that have much fruit; ſpare a part to them that have but little, or none of their own, and be no niggards but liberall to their neighbours: And this bounty will bring a double bleſſing, firſt from God to increaſe the fruits; ſecondly from men not to demi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh them.</p>
               <p>But I hartily wiſh that ſuch as make but a ſport of robbing an Orchard, would but conſider the affliction, and terrors of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience that ſeiſed upon good <hi>Auſten,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">See the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Book of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions.

                  </label> I Anſwere, that though the Objection were true, that trees Planted would be long ere they come to bearing fruits, perhaps 20 yeares or more, yet this ſhould not diſcourage us: eſpecially ſuch as may have good hopes to enjoy the profits, and pleaſures of them many years after, and then leave them to their Children and to poſterity after them. But men are generally miſtaken up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Accompt, Fruit trees rightly ordered, will not be ſo long ere they beare fruits as they ſuppoſe: I ſhall ſhew a way that by Planting Fruit-trees, and ordering of them as I give di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:130473:17"/> (By the bleſſing of a divine hand that ſtill attends honeſt labours) we may receive <hi>Profit and Pleaſure</hi> from them in halfe <hi>Twenty years,</hi> yea in <hi>halfe that halfe,</hi> yea in leſſe then in <hi>five years:</hi> ſometimes the <hi>third,</hi> ſometimes the ſecond yeare, (of many kinds of fruit-trees) after Grafting: Experience proves it, though we muſt know, the fruit cannot be much, while the trees are ſo ſmall, of particulars: yet a multitude of ſuch trees will afford a multitude of fruits: <hi>A Ciſterne of water is but a multitude of drops.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So then; that Fruit-trees may be planted and come to bearing fruits in 5, 4, <hi>or</hi> 3, <hi>yeares,</hi> or ſooner, the meanes is ſhew'd at large in the enſuing worke.

               <p>God hath threatned to withhold his bleſſing in theſe things, if we doe not obey him, and hath in diſpleaſure often deprived men of the ſame for their <hi>diſobedience,</hi> which proves them to be of <hi>value</hi> and <hi>worth:</hi> for when God is diſpleaſed with a people, or particular perſons, and will ſhew it by ſome correction, that hee may bring them to repentance, he doth it not by withholding, or taking from them ſome ſmall matters, that they can eaſily ſpare without griefe or trouble, for that would worke no effect, but by withholding or depriving them of ſomething that's precious, and deare to them, the want, or loſſe of which, will ſad the heart: which courſe God hath obſerved with people, concerning theſe particular bleſſings. As apeares.</p>
               <p n="1">1 This was part of two of the <hi>tenne Plagues,</hi> wherewith <hi>Aegypt</hi> was puniſhed, Exod. 9.55. <hi>The haile brake every tree of the field.</hi> And as the <hi>Prophet David</hi> hath it, Pſ 78.48. <hi>He deſtroyed their Vines with haile, and their Mulbery trees with froſt:</hi> and Pſal: 105.33. <hi>He ſmote their Vines alſo, and Fig-trees:</hi> and Ex: 10. 5. <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſts did eat all the Fruit of the trees which the haile had left.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2 Secondly, Among the <hi>ſignes of Gods diſpleaſure</hi> againſt <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raell:</hi> this is one, Amos, 4 9. <hi>I have ſmitten your Fruit-trees, &amp;c. yet have you not returned unto me, ſaith the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3 Thirdly: The <hi>Prophet</hi> calls to mourning, Joel, 1.12. For, <hi>The Vine is dried up, the Figtree languiſheth, the Pomegranate tree, the Palme tree alſo, and the Apple tree, even all the trees of the field are withered, becauſe joy is withered from among the ſonnes of men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4 Fourthly: God in diſpleaſure for ſin tells them, Deut. 28.39 4. <hi>Thou ſhalt plant Vineyards and dreſſe them, but ſhalt neither drink of the wine, nor gather the grapes for the wormes ſhall eat them. Thou ſhalt haue Olive trees throughout all thy coaſts, but ſhalt not anoint thy ſelfe with Oyle: for thine Olive ſhall caſt her fruit:</hi> And God bids <hi>Moſes</hi> tell the people, if they would not obey, <hi>their land ſhould not yeeld their increaſe, neither ſhould the trees of the land yeeld their fruits.</hi> The like againe, Zeph, 1.13. Amos 5.11. Eſay, 17, 10. Hoſea, 2.12.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>God hath promiſed theſe things as bleſſings to ſuch as obay him, &amp; from time to time performed it:</hi> Not to be look't upon as things of light, and triviall conſequence, but to be conſidered as ſtrong en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements to obedience. When God hath beene well pleaſed with a Nation, or particular perſons he hath often ſhewed it (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong other tokens of his love) <hi>by multiplying the fruits of their trees,</hi> encouraging them to <hi>plant Fruit-gardens,</hi> and promiſing his bleſſing thereon. As we ſee.</p>
               <p n="1">1 God (by his Prophet) encourages his people in <hi>Babylon</hi> to build, and to plant, Jer: 29.5. <hi>Build yee houſes, and dwell in them, and plant gardens and eat the fruits of them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2 And in the promiſe of their returne, this was one of the bleſſings God would beſtow on them, Amos, 9.14. <hi>And I will bring againe the captivity of my people Iſraell, and they ſhall build the waſt citties and inhabite them, and they ſhall plant Vineyards, and drinke the wine thereof, they ſhall alſo make gardens and eat the fruit of them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3 Thirdly, When they came into <hi>Canaan</hi> that pleaſant land, this is mentioned as one of the bleſſings, Neh: 9.25. <hi>They poſſeſſed houſes full of all goods, wells digged, Vineyards and Oliveyards, and fruit-trees in abundance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4 And among the ſhowers of bleſſings (as the Prophet calls them) this is one, Ezek: 34.27. <hi>The tree of the field ſhall yeeld her fruit.</hi> And Ezek: 36.29. <hi>I will multiply the fruit of the Tree.</hi> The like of many other places, Mal: 3.10.11. Joel. 2.21.22. Levit: 26.3.4. Eſay 65.21.22. Levit. 19.23. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And thus much of the ſixt <hi>Divine Argument from the promiſes of God, and performance of them, in theſe things</hi> to his people.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Argument: </seg>7</label> Another <hi>Divine Argument of the Dignitie and value of Fruit-trees, and the art of planting,</hi> is from <hi>two generall commands given by the Apoſtle Paul,</hi> which though they mention not theſe things in explicite and plaine tearmes, yet they are commended to us <hi>by plaine and cleare implication, and deduction:</hi> for as out of <hi>generall promiſes</hi> we may draw, and deduct particulars, and make applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from them; So alſo from <hi>generall commands and directions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The firſt <hi>Command</hi> is that of <hi>Paul</hi> in his Epiſtle to <hi>Titus</hi> Ch. 3.14. <hi>Let ours alſo learne to maintaine good workes for neceſſary uſes, that they be not unfruitfull:</hi> here's a generall <hi>Command,</hi> out of which one particular may be derived for the preſent purpoſe.
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:130473:23"/> The Apoſtle here, by <hi>Good workes,</hi> meanes good works as they are towards the maintenance of the <hi>Commonwealth, or a particular Family</hi> with neceſſary commodities and uſefull things, as <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt Trades, and imploiments,</hi> as the Margent renders it.</p>
               <p>Now it is cleare, <hi>this worke and imployment of Planting Fruit-trees, is a good worke for neceſſary uſes,</hi> ſeeing the life of man may by it be maintained with ſo many neceſſaries belonging to it: See <hi>Profits of an Orchard,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This being ſo, the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> (then) bids us <hi>learne to doe it,</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, get ſome skill in it, and be doing, then <hi>uphold &amp; main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond <hi>generall Command</hi> is that which the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> writes to the <hi>Philippians,</hi> Chap. 4 8. <hi>Whatſoever things are True: whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver things are Honeſt: whatſoever things are Juſt: whatſoever things are Pure: whatſoever things are Lovely: whatſoever things are of Good Report: if there be any Virtue, if there be any Praiſe, thinke on theſe things.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now it is eaſily for a man to ſpeake of many particular <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments,</hi> which have upon them the <hi>Characters and Marks</hi> here mentioned: but of all of them, I know not one (except Divine Imployments) that hath theſe <hi>Marks</hi> ſo clearely ſtampt upon it, as this <hi>Imployment</hi> of the husbandman in <hi>Planting Fruit-trees. This imployment</hi> anſwers exactly to the <hi>Apoſtles Rule,</hi> as it were face anſwering face in the glaſſe: for what particular labour is more <hi>honeſt,</hi> more <hi>iuſt,</hi> more <hi>pure:</hi> more <hi>lovely:</hi> of better <hi>Report:</hi> what hath more <hi>Vertue,</hi> vvhat hath more <hi>Praiſe</hi> then it: See vvhat hath been ſaid in the <hi>Praiſe and good report</hi> of it, and the reſt of the <hi>Properties,</hi> at large: already mentioned.</p>
               <p>Novv this being ſo, then we ought to follow the <hi>Apoſtles Command:</hi> If there be any <hi>Vertue,</hi> if there be any <hi>Praiſe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>thinke on theſe things.</hi> The words are very Emphaticall: <hi>whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and if there be any praiſe.</hi> His meaning is, whatſoever the vvork be, though mean in the eye of the vvorld, yet, if there be but any one of theſe <hi>Characters and Marks</hi> upon it, it is vvorthy to be follovved, then hovv much more vvhen it has them <hi>All,</hi> &amp; that ſo eminently, as that every eye ſees them. <hi>Think on theſe things,</hi> ſaith he, firſt, to ſearch out vvhat <hi>works and imployments</hi> are markt vvith theſe <hi>Characters:</hi> and then, <hi>think on ſuch</hi> to like, and chuſe them, to ſet about them, to follovv them, and make ſuch

               <p>We ſee God ingeminates, &amp; repeats his charge to preſerve the <hi>Fruit-trees, being trees for food, and nouriſhment of mans life,</hi> they muſt not be deſtroyed, though it were on ſo great an occaſion as to further the ſiege againſt their enimies.

A late Author ſaies, that <hi>Apple trees</hi> and <hi>Peare-trees</hi> (and ſome other kinds of Fruit-trees) on good land, and duly ordered, will laſt 800 or 900 yeares.</p>
               <p>What earthly thing is better then a <hi>good Name.

               </p>
               <p>One way to gaine, and keep <hi>a good name</hi> is by <hi>Gifts and Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits:</hi> the worſt temper of minds are wonne, and held by <hi>Gifts and good turnes,</hi> it's naturall to all creatures to love thoſe that doe them good. Now who can <hi>ſo eaſily</hi> give <hi>ſo great, ſo many,</hi> and <hi>ſo acceptable gifts</hi> as the husbandman that yearely nurſeth up mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes of <hi>Fruit-trees,</hi> and hath ſtore of <hi>pleaſant fruits, wines, and delicates</hi> made of them.

               <p>And ſecondly, as <hi>Gifts and good turnes,</hi> gaine <hi>a good name,</hi> ſo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to be converſant and imployed about works for the <hi>Publique and generall profit of a Commonwealth:</hi> ſuch works produce the ſame effect.</p>
               <p>We know, all labours and imployments that bring both <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit and Pleaſure,</hi> are approved and praiſed of all, though the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage be but to a private family, how much more when they are for a <hi>Commonwealth.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:130473:30"/>
               <p>And beſides this <hi>Morall Conſideration,</hi> God hath promiſed the great bleſſing of a <hi>good name</hi> to them that are converſant in good imployments, Rom: 13.3. <hi>Doe that which is good, and thou ſhalt have praiſe of the ſame,</hi> Rom: 2.10. <hi>Glory, honour, and peace, to every one that worketh good, upon the Jew firſt, and alſo on the Gentile.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So then, the work of <hi>Planting Fruit-trees</hi> is <hi>profitable to the name</hi> of the Husbandman both while he lives, and in Generations after him.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, An <hi>Orchard or Garden of Fruit-trees</hi> &amp; the imployment about them is <hi>profitable to others:</hi>

               <p>This <hi>profit to others</hi> is by beſtowing our fruits on friends, and neighbours, and ſuch as want. For though God require not to himſelfe (as formerly) <hi>the firſt of all the fruits of all trees, yeare by yeare,</hi> Nehem. 10.35. Yet God requires yeare by yeare, when he beſtowes all upon us, that we ſhould give a part to himſelfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, that is, to his poore members, that want them.</p>
               <p>This is the way to obtaine a bleſſing upon all our labours. Deut. 15.10. <hi>Thou ſhalt ſurely give unto him (that is unto thy poore brother) and thine heart ſhall not be grieved when thou giveſt unto him, becauſe that for this thing the Lord thy God ſhall bleſſe thee, in all thy works, and in all thou putteſt thy hand unto.</hi>

               <p>No doubt we may uſe theſe, and other earthly bleſſings with Rejoycing: but all the danger is, leaſt we take too much liberty herein, and breake beyond our bounds.</p>
               <p>Theſe <hi>Profits</hi> and <hi>Pleaſures,</hi> being multiply'd in the Garden of Fruit-trees, we had beſt beware of reaching after them too ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly: <hi>Latet Anguis in Herba,</hi> A ſubtle ſerpent lyes hid among theſe pleaſant ſlowers, and ſeekes to bite us by his temptations, who has as much or more malice, and policy now, as formerly againſt our firſt Parents, whom he deceived <hi>in a Garden of Fruit-trees.</hi>

                  </note>We may eaſily miſtake betweene the uſe of earthly bleſſings, and the enjoyment of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Auſtin</hi> tells us, no earthly bleſſings are properly to be Enjoy'd but uſed only: <hi>Res aliae ſunt, quibus fruendum eſt, aliae quibus u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendum, illae, quibus fruendum eſt, beatos nos faciunt, iſtis quibus u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendum eſt, tendentes ad beatitudinem adjuvamur, &amp; quaſi admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culamur, ut ad illas, quae nos beatos faciunt, proveniamus. There are ſome things (ſaith he) which are to be enjoy'd, others to be us'd; thoſe which we ought to enjoy make us happy, ſuch as we ought to uſe only, are thoſe whereby we are furthered, and are as ſuccors, aids and helps, to bring us to thoſe things which may be enjoy'd and make us happy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He tells us then, whom, and what we may enjoy, <hi>Fruendum eſt Patre, &amp; filio, &amp; Spiritu Sancto. Beatum eſt ad tale bonum proveniſſe, quo amplius non poteſt. The Father, the Sonne, and bleſſed ſpirit are to be enjoy'd. And its true bleſſedneſſe to attaine to that</hi> good, <hi>which is the higheſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So then: God only is to be <hi>enjoyed,</hi> and the good things of this life only to be <hi>uſed,</hi> as helps and furtherances unto God. We had need therefore take heed of falling in love with Earthly things: The foreſaid Author tells us the danger of it.<note place="margin">De doct. Chriſt. lib. <hi>1.</hi>

And as to the obtaining of thoſe things which we ought to enjoy (by the love of earthly things) we are call'd back from them, and much retarded, and ſtop't in our way to them. And if the <hi>Pleaſures</hi> and <hi>Contentments</hi> of the journey and the carriage, by which we are conveyed over much pleaſe and delight us, then we turne to <hi>Enjoying</hi> of thoſe things which we ought but only <hi>to uſe,</hi> and therefore are unwilling to come to our journies end, and are intangled in corrupt delights, and brought thereby to be eſtranged from the Countrie, the ſweetneſſe and pleaſure whereof maketh bleſſed.</p>
               <p>We ſee then, when God gives us bleſſings largely, and gives us leave to uſe them freely, we are in danger to forget him: We had need therefore to ſet a watch, or guard upon our hearts, leaſt <hi>Profits</hi> and <hi>Pleaſures</hi> ſteale it, and keep it to themſelves.

               <p>And in ſetting in all <hi>Grafts</hi> into the cleft, obſerve this for <hi>a moſt ſpeciall Rule,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">A ſpeciall Rule.</note> 
                  <hi>to joyne the inner ſide of the barke of the Graft, to the inner ſide of the barke of the ſtocke,</hi> that the ſap may more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily come out of the <hi>Stock</hi> into the <hi>Graft</hi> to feed it, for the main current of the <hi>ſap is betweene the bark and the wood.</hi> And regard not the cuſtome of many Grafters, in ſetting the <hi>outſides even and ſmooth,</hi> not conſidering the <hi>inſides,</hi> their ſucceſſe is according to their skill, for the moſt part. We know the Bark of a big ſtock is much thicker then the bark of a ſlender graft, &amp; if the <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides</hi>
                  <pb n="49" facs="tcp:130473:37"/> be ſmooth, and <hi>even,</hi> the <hi>inſides</hi> muſt needs be <hi>uneven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But I ſay, to joyne <hi>the inner ſides of both barks together, all along the cleft,</hi> is the <hi>Principall thing in Grafting</hi> of ſuch big ſtocks.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Grafts</hi> being thus placed in the <hi>Stocks,</hi> and the wedg pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led out, then <hi>Clay</hi> them cloſe on every ſide, an inch above the top of the ſtock, to the bottome of the Cleft.</p>

               <p>Graft every <hi>Cyence</hi> into its own kind: as all kind of <hi>Apples</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and alſo on <hi>Crabſtocks</hi> (which is the <hi>wild Apple) Pear-grafts,</hi> on <hi>wild Pear-ſtocks,</hi> &amp; the like of other kinds: joyn not contrary, or different kinds, they never come to perfection: as <hi>Cherry grafts on Plum-ſtocks,</hi> or the like.

               <p>And in <hi>choice of Grafts,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Obſerve the beſt bearing-trees.</note> be ſure to conſider what Trees (of all kinds) are the beſt bearers, ſome kinds ſeldome miſſe, and ſome other kinds (though good fruits) ſeldome hit, and therefore, take information from thoſe perſons, that know (by experience) the nature of the Trees in this regard, and accordingly choſe, or refuſe, Grafts from them. Obſerve the like in choyce of <hi>Vines:</hi> The <hi>Parſley Vine</hi> of all other is beſt for theſe parts.</p>
               <p>Such <hi>Grafts</hi> as are bound (as is ſaid of the two firſt waies of <hi>Grafting</hi>) muſt be <hi>unbound</hi> after a certain time,<note place="margin">

               <p>After <hi>Grafts</hi> have had their full growth the firſt yeare,<note place="margin">Prune young Grafts.</note> they muſt be <hi>Pruned,</hi> ſuch as neede <hi>Pruning:</hi> As <hi>for wall Plants</hi> its noe matter of how many Branches they ſpread, more the better:

               <p>And from yeare to yeare, prune off thoſe ſhoots, and branches as are ſuperfluous and grow too neer one another, and preſerve only ſuch as are fit to make the Tree of a comely forme.

               <p>And ſo much concerning <hi>Grafting,</hi> and alſo <hi>Pruning</hi> while they are young Plants.</p>
               <p>I ſhall now ſpeak of the other work whereby Fruit-trees are increaſed. <hi>Inoculating,</hi> or putting a ſmall Bud into a ſtock, which (as to the effects of it) is the ſame with <hi>Grafting,</hi> but differs much in the ſeaſon, and in the manner of the work.</p>
               <p>The time for <hi>Inoculating Buds</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Inoculating Buds.</note> is about <hi>Midſommer,</hi> a fortnight before, &amp; a fortnight after is the chiefe <hi>ſeaſon:</hi> though. Some Plants (full of ſap) may be done afterwards with good ſucceſſe.</p>
               <p>That this buſineſſe may be done to good purpoſe, it muſt be conſidered whether the <hi>Buds</hi> which we meane to get, are ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently grown or not, they muſt not be <hi>too young and tender:</hi> and we ſhall finde that ſome kinds of Trees have <hi>Buds</hi> ready ſooner then others. As the <hi>Aprecott</hi> eſpecially, and thoſe that ſhoot ſtrongly. Let then the <hi>biggeſt and ſtrongeſt ſhoots</hi> be cut from the Tree, that have grown ſince the ſpring, to that time, and cut off the top of the ſhoot, (all theſe <hi>Buds</hi> that are too ſmall and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and alſo cut off the Leaves of the other about a quarter of an inch from the <hi>Bud,</hi> and by that part left, we hold the <hi>Bud,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken off the Branch: but leave not on the whole <hi>leafe and ſtalke,</hi> as ſome doe, for the aire (by meanes of the leafe) extracts and drawes out the ſap of the <hi>Bud</hi> in a ſhort time, and ſo ſpoiles it.<note place="margin">Obſerve the kindes.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Then goe to the Plants you intend to <hi>Inoculate</hi> which muſt
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:130473:38"/> be like (as to the generall kinds) with the <hi>Buds</hi> that you intend to ſet on: as <hi>Aprecot Buds,</hi> and other <hi>Plum-Buds</hi> on <hi>Plumſtocks</hi> that are wild ſtocks: the <hi>White Peare plum ſtock</hi> is accounted the beſt to <hi>inoculate Aprecot buds</hi> on, or other choice <hi>Plums,</hi> it being a Plant full of ſap: and in chuſing <hi>Buds,</hi> or <hi>Grafts,</hi> be ſure alwaies to cut them from thoſe kinds that experience ſhewes are good <hi>bearing Trees.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now in ſetting on the <hi>Bud,</hi> firſt make a croſſe cut <hi>upon ſome ſmooth place</hi> of the ſtock, (if it be for a wall-tree, then halfe a foot, or thereabouts from the ground) &amp; from the middle of the croſſe cut, make another ſtraight down, about an <hi>Inch long,</hi> or ſomething leſſe, only through the Bark, and with the end of a Pen-knife, raiſe up the bark on both ſides, as much as to let in the ſmall <hi>Bud,</hi> then make haſt to prepare the <hi>bud</hi> (for a man muſt be quick at this work, elſe the Aire, by ſudden drying the <hi>Bud,</hi> and the cut part of the ſtock will much hurt:) Cut the bark on both ſides the <hi>Bud,</hi> and about a quarter of an inch a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, and as much below the <hi>bud,</hi> and let that end which is to be downwards be a little ſharp, that it may more eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly goe downe, betweene the Barke, and wood of the ſtocke, and throw away the bark on the oppoſite ſide, then with a <hi>Quill</hi> the one halfe cut away, or a <hi>Pen of ſteele,</hi> (made thin for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe) take off the <hi>Bud and bark,</hi> and be ſure there be the <hi>root of the Bud</hi> in it, if there be a little hole <hi>in the middle of the bud with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,</hi> then the <hi>root</hi> is not there, throw away that bud, ſuch will not grow, but the <hi>Bud</hi> being well taken off, then hold it by the ſtalk of the leafe, as before was ſaid, and put it carefully <hi>betweene the bark and the wood</hi> of the ſmall Plant, prepared as before, and let the top of the <hi>bud</hi> joyne cloſe to the croſſe cut, then bind the <hi>bud</hi> with a ſoft <hi>Ruſh,</hi> that is ſtrong, bind it cloſe to the ſtock, eſpecially in the middle (where the <hi>Root of the bud lies</hi>) and ſo let it reſt.</p>
               <p>After a certaine time the <hi>Buds</hi> muſt be unbound,<note place="margin">

               <p>Now if this worke be done early in the yeare
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:130473:39"/> before Midſommer, upon young ſtocks very full of ſap, theſe may be unbound about 14. or 15. daies after, or a <hi>Generall Rule</hi> may be this, when a ſtock is ſo grown as that the band about the <hi>Bud,</hi> does much ſtraighten the <hi>Bud,</hi> which may be ſeen by the ſwelling of the Plant above and below the <hi>Bud,</hi> then the band muſt be cut and taken off. But thoſe that are done neere the end of July or after, will not need unbinding ſo ſoon. Now after un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binding you may ſee which <hi>Buds</hi> take hold of the ſtock, and which doe not, thoſe that are good, are faſt upon the ſtock, and appeare in their naturall colours as when they were ſet on, thoſe that doe not hold, will have loſt their colour, and (it may be) wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered and dri'd.</p>
               <p>Such as are good, meddle no more with them till the <hi>Spring,</hi> then cut off the ſtocks an inch or two above the <hi>Buds,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Cut off ſtocks above the Buds.</note> ſo the <hi>Buds</hi> will ſpring out and grow according to the ſtrength of the ſtocks.

               <p>So alſo in the practiſe: and therefore it has many times fallen out that ſome men having laboured much &amp; ſpent much time, &amp; coſt, <hi>in Planting Fruit-trees,</hi> yet their labours have not ſuccee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded well, becauſe there has been miſtakes <hi>in ſome principall, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry materiall things;</hi> either the Trees have not grown well, or if pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpered, and come to a large grouth, yet they have not borne Fruit well, which hath been a great diſcouragement, not only to themſelves, but to others who have ſeen it.</p>
               <p>Now among all <hi>Obſervations</hi> about this <hi>Art of Planting Fruit-trees,</hi> I know none of <hi>greater moment, or more eſſentiall</hi> to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable proceeding in it, then the <hi>Choice of right kinds, and the joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Grafts, Buds, and Stocks fit for each other.</hi> I ſhall therefore mention ſome particulars of the <hi>Twelve kindes of Fruit-trees</hi> which I have made choice to ſpeak of, and ſhew which I account <hi>moſt profitable, and beſt to propagate and increaſe, and how they fit ſeverall ſtocks</hi> when the <hi>Cyences</hi> are to be <hi>Engrafted.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt concerning <hi>Apples:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Of Apples.</note> In the choice of <hi>Apple Grafts</hi> we muſt conſider not only the <hi>goodneſſe of the Fruit,</hi> but alſo, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Trees be <hi>good bearing Trees naturally:</hi> whether ſuch as have known them divers yeares, can ſay by experience <hi>they beare well,</hi> but many look not after this ſo much as what kind of fruit it is, <hi>In reſpect of goodneſſe.</hi> And thence it comes to paſſe, that ſome men having ſtore of faire, large Fruit-trees, they have but little fruit from them. Therefore let the <hi>generalitie of Fruit-trees</hi> (both in the <hi>Orchards</hi> and in the <hi>Fields</hi>) be of <hi>right kindes in reſpect of bearing,</hi> as well as in reſpect of <hi>goodneſſe</hi> of the fruit, and then for variety, there may be ſome of other kinds of good and choice fruits though they beare but few, and ſeldome.</p>
               <p>And for particular kinds of Apples I commend the <hi>Sommer-Pearemaine,</hi>
                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:130473:40"/> and the <hi>Winter Pearemaine,</hi> not only for ſpeciall fruits, but alſo for <hi>good bearing kinds.</hi> So likewiſe the ſmall <hi>Pip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pin, a good Apple, and a great bearer.</hi> The <hi>Harvey Apple</hi> is a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry choice fruit, and the trees beare well. The <hi>Queene Apple</hi> is a <hi>great bearing fruit,</hi> and good: So the <hi>Gillofloure.</hi> Many other kinds might be named, that are ſpeciall good fruits, and <hi>great bearing kindes,</hi> and ſome perſons prefer one kind, and ſome another. But the great and <hi>generall Rule</hi> in this, and all other kinds of Fruits, is, to <hi>take Grafts from thoſe Trees which are knowne by experience to beare ſtore of fruits, and good,</hi> and to multiply theſe as much as may be.</p>
               <p>As for <hi>Stocks</hi> fit for <hi>Apple Grafts,</hi> I account <hi>Crab-trees,</hi> better then ſweeter Apple-trees to Graft on, becauſe they are uſually free from the <hi>Canker,</hi> and will become <hi>very large Trees,</hi> and I conceive will laſt longer then Stocks of ſweeter Apple-trees, and will make fruits more ſtrong, and hardy to endure froſts, and cold weather in the ſpring time: yet it is good to chuſe ſtocks of ſome pleaſant Apples, to graft ſome choice fruit upon. Becauſe that the ſtock has ſome ſmall influence upon the fruits to make them more delicate, if grafted upon a <hi>choice ſtock.</hi> Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though notwithſtanding the graft may be ſaid to Governe, as is ſhew'd at large.</p>

                     <hi>2</hi> Of Peares.</note>As for <hi>Peares</hi> there are multituds of kinds, as well as of <hi>Apples,</hi> ſome preferring one kind and ſome another, and one and the ſame fruit is called by ſeverall names, in ſeverall places. A late Author ſaies he is perſwaded there are 400. or 500. <hi>ſeverall kinds of Peares.</hi> Now therefore; it is a point of wiſdome to chuſe <hi>Grafts</hi> from <hi>the beſt bearing kinds,</hi> although (it may be) not ſo delicate to eat as ſome others. I know none but they are very uſefull, and profitable.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Winſor Peare</hi> is accounted one of the beſt with us, ſome kinds beare not well, but ſome others doe, therefore obſerve the former <hi>Rule.</hi> The <hi>ſommer Burgamet</hi> is a choice fruit, and the Trees beare well.</p>
               <p>But for a coſtant bearing kind. I know none better then the <hi>Catherin peare,</hi> but they muſt be quickly ſpent, for they are no laſting fruits: a man having great ſtore, may make excellent <hi>Perry</hi> of them. For they have a pleaſant juyce.</p>

               <p>The <hi>Greenefield Peare</hi> is an excellent <hi>Peare,</hi> and will laſt indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent well, and is <hi>a great bearer.</hi>

               <p>There is a <hi>Peare</hi> they call a <hi>choke-Peare,</hi> which is accounted a ſpeciall kind, for <hi>Perry,</hi> although the <hi>Peare</hi> to eat, is ſtark naught, and therefore men may adventure to plant the Trees in the <hi>fields and hedges,</hi> and need not feare ſtealing of the fruits.

               <p>The beſt kind of <hi>ſtocks</hi> to graft <hi>Peare-grafts</hi> upon, are ſuch as come of the <hi>Seeds or Kernells of Peares.</hi> I know no difference a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt theſe, but all good to graft upon.

               </p>
               <p>There are many kinds of <hi>Cherries,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>3</hi> Of Cherries.</note> The <hi>Flanders-Cherry</hi> is moſt generally planted here in England, and is <hi>a great bearing fruit.</hi> there are two ſorts of them, the <hi>Early,</hi> and the <hi>late Flanders;</hi> the early is almoſt as ſoone as the <hi>May-Cherry,</hi> it follows cloſe after, and then the <hi>late Flanders-Cherry</hi> upon that.

               <p>The <hi>black hart Cherry</hi> is a very ſpeciall fruit, and a <hi>great bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fruit;</hi> and doubtleſſe exceeding proper to preſſe for wine, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to drinke of it ſelfe, or to mix the juyce with <hi>Syder</hi> to give it a <hi>colour,</hi> as <hi>Clarret-wine.</hi> it being of a deepe red, and a ſmall quantity of it, will colour a gallon of <hi>Syder or white-wine.</hi> There is a <hi>Cherry</hi> we call the <hi>great bearing cherry,</hi> of M.

               <pb n="56" facs="tcp:130473:41"/>
               <p>This kind of fruit is moſt fit for <hi>cold Countries</hi> in the North-parts, and although it be not altogether ſo pleaſant as ſome other <hi>Cherries,</hi> by reaſon of the tartneſſe of the juyce, yet let men know that <hi>ſharp Cherries</hi> are accounted more wholſome then the <hi>ſweet.</hi> And ſuch as plant Trees of this kind may have good ſtore of Fruits, when others (it may be) want, who have none of theſe Trees.</p>
               <p>Concerning <hi>Stocks</hi> fit for <hi>Cherry-trees,</hi> I account the <hi>black Cherry ſtock</hi> the beſt, to graft any kind of <hi>Cherry</hi> upon.

               <p>The <hi>White Peare-plum ſtocke,</hi> (though accounted the beſt for any <hi>plum,</hi> yet I find) is ſcarce good enough for this fruit to be <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oculated</hi> upon it, though ſome doe indifferent well.</p>

Stay not (as the cuſtome is) till November, or after, before you <hi>tranſplant,</hi> for the beſt time is about the later end of Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember, but becauſe ſome trees are ready for <hi>Tranſplanting</hi> ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner then others, obſerve this <hi>Rule.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Immediatly after Plants have done growing, its beſt to tranſplant them.</hi> And when they have done growing may be ſeen by the <hi>top, or end</hi> of the Plant, the top of the Branches will be cloſed, or ſhut up, and no more ſmall Leaves will appeare, as in thoſe that have not done growing.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Early Remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving beſt.</note>Its a great advantage to <hi>remove plants be time,</hi> for ſuch grow a while after in their <hi>Roots</hi> before winter, and thereby not only preſerve themſelves in winter, but alſo make ſome preparation againſt the <hi>Spring:</hi> which thoſe <hi>removed in winter</hi> cannot doe Stay not therefore till the Leaves fall ere you remove, although they may be remov'd <hi>then</hi> with good ſucceſſe, but it is not ſo good at that time as before.</p>
               <p>The <hi>time of removing</hi> being come, and the place prepared for ſetting them againe, then be carefull in taking up the plants, dig round about them, and take off the mould from their Roots, if it be a ſmall plant it may be drawn up eaſily, the mould being ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away, if it be great, and the Roots ſpread much, then they
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:130473:43"/> may be cut about halfe a yard from the body of the Plant, and the greater it is, the further off cut the Roots: and ſo draw it up: and break off all the Leaves the firſt thing you doe, for the Sun and Aire (by meanes of them) extract the ſap of the branches.</p>
               <p>The next work is to prune the Roots and branches,<note place="margin">Prune the roots.</note> as they need. All the ends of the Roots muſt be cut ſmooth, and moſt of the ſmall ſtrings, or fibra's cut away, that ſo the mould may cloſe to every ſide of thoſe that are left, and new ſtrings may put forth at the cut place: and leave not all the Roots (as the cuſtome of ſome is) it much hinders the grouth, the mould cannot poſſibly be made to cloſe about all of them being many, as it may about a few.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe if the Plant be of 3 or 4 yeares grouth or more,<note place="margin">Prune the Branches.</note> ſome of the Branches muſt be cut, &amp; ſay not as many doe, her'es a faire tree already, why ſhould we cut away any part of it? but they muſt be content to looſe ſome of the Branches, elſe they are in danger to looſe all: for removing of great Plants, is a great check to nature, and if a few Roots cut ſhort (as they muſt be when removed) be put to feed many and large Branches, they'l have but ſlender and poore nouriſhment, not ſufficient many times to preſerve life, much leſſe to make a large grouth.</p>
               <p>But if Plants are very ſmall (of a yeare or two yeares grouth) you need not cut the Branches, except ſuch as croſſe one another or grow too nigh together, but cut off the ends of the Roots of all, becauſe if cut, many ſmall ſtrings or fibra's ſhoot out at the cut place, which draw nouriſhment for the Plant, which without cutting would not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Plants</hi> being thus prepared,<note place="margin">Set not plants too deep.</note> the next thing is to ſet them again in the ground. If the ſoyl be dry they muſt be ſet ſo much the deeper, yet take heed of ſetting below the good ſoyl. In low and moiſt grounds ſet not ſo deep, as in that which is dry. The hole for the Plant being digged, ſet in the Root prepared as before, and caſt in the ſmalleſt, and beſt mould next to the Roots, and ſee that the ſmall mould runne between all the Roots, to that end, ſtir and ſhake the Plant, that there may not be any hollow place where the mould falls not, and being filled up, water the Plant that the mould thereby may ſettle cloſe about all the Roots, and ſo let it reſt.</p>
               <p>If the Plants are faire large Plants, in danger to be ſhaken by
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:130473:44"/> the winds, then knock down a ſtake cloſe to every one, and tye the Plant to it with a <hi>hay-Band,</hi> or ſome other ſoft <hi>Band.</hi>

                  <note place="margin">Diſtance of ſetting.</note>As concerning <hi>diſtance</hi> in ſetting young trees I conceive <hi>Tenne yards</hi> is litle enough between <hi>Apple-trees, and Peare-trees,</hi> in ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary ſoyle. And if men have ground enough to plant, and good ſoyle, I ſhould rather preſcribe to Plant them 16, or 20 <hi>yards a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſunder</hi> for both Trees and fruits have many great <hi>advantages,</hi> if planted <hi>a good diſtance</hi> one from another.</p>
               <p>(As for Wall-trees they may be planted 5 or 6 yards aſunder.)</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The <hi>1</hi> Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage.</note>Such are freed from frettings, &amp; gallings, that happens to Trees that bruſh, and croud one upon another, whereby not only the <hi>Buds, Bloſſomes,</hi> and <hi>Fruits,</hi> are rub'd and broken off, but alſo ſometimes the <hi>Canker</hi> thereby breeds and deſtroies boughs, and Branches.</p>

                  <note place="margin">The <hi>4</hi> Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage.</note>Fourthly.

               <p>It is a very great, and almoſt a generall Errour, the <hi>Planting of Fruit-trees too neere together,</hi> eſpecially as to <hi>Apple-trees, and Pear-trees;</hi> as for <hi>Cherry-trees, plum-trees</hi> and the like, they need not be planted halfe the diſtance I ſpeak of, 5 <hi>or</hi> 6 <hi>yards in diſtance</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Concerning <hi>Order</hi> in ſetting Trees,<note place="margin">Order in ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Trees.</note> though it be not eſſentiall to a good Orchard, yet if men ſtand upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it, they may meaſure out a ſquare plot of ground (more or leſſe) by a line, and then mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure the diſtance that muſt be betweene every tree, according to the <hi>kinds</hi> that are to be planted, and according to the <hi>good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi> or nature of the ſoile as hath been ſaid.

And by this meanes the Trees will ſtand in Rowes every way. This ſquare once planted, though but ſmall at firſt, may be enlarged every way, as the ground permits, or elſe the Orchard may be drawn out in length, and yet the Trees ſtand in a right Line eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry way by this meanes.<note place="margin">A ſpeciall rule in tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planting.</note>
               </p>
               <p>In ſetting all ſorts of Trees conſider what ſoile they came out of, whether a fat, and forc'd ſoile (as divers of the Nurſeries about <hi>London</hi>) or ſome ordinary naturall ſoile. If they came out of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good ground, then procure as good or better, if it may be had, though but a little: to lay next to their Roots when they are ſet againe. This ſhould alwaies be obſerved. <hi>To Plant Trees in as good or better ſoile being remov'd, as that out of which they were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.</hi> For every thing in nature advanced to the better, it is grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and beneficiall to it, but if it be carried to the worſe, it is a check, and repulſe to nature, and ſuch a one, as that if it be in any great degree, it either much weakens it, or quite deſtroies it. Therefore chuſe Trees out of <hi>naturall ſoyles,</hi> and the worſe, the better for the Trees, but if they muſt be had out of rich ſoyles, then be ſure to procure ſome (more or leſſe) of as good, or better then that out of which they are remov'd, to lay to their Roots, when ſet againe.</p>
               <p>For want of obſerving this courſe, many hundred of good plants have been loſt from time to time. The well ordering of young Plants <hi>the firſt and ſecond yeare</hi> of planting, has an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence upon them many yeares, which if neglected <hi>then,</hi>
                  <pb n="64" facs="tcp:130473:45"/> the labour, and diligence of many yeares after; cannot coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervaile it, the ordering of Cattell while they are young, either makes or marrs them, ſo of Trees, and other things in ſome proportion; after they have well taken Roote the firſt and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond yeare, they will then grow in ordinary ſoyles, the great danger is at firſt planting.</p>
               <p>Concerning <hi>Wall-trees:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Wall-trees.</note> the <hi>Aprecot, Peach, Nectarine, Vine-tree &amp;c.</hi> theſe and ſuch choice fruit-trees, muſt be planted upon a <hi>South-wall,</hi> if it may be; The beſt next that I accompt the Eaſt-wall, and the Weſt not ſo good, the North-wall is nothing worth, as having no advantage by the ſunne as the other.</p>
               <p>Theſe trees being ſet (as before is ſaid) they muſt be plaiſht, or ſpread upon the Wall, being young, (and ſo from yeare to yeare as they grow greater) with <hi>Nailes, and Lethers.</hi> And as they grow larger, cut only ſome of the ſuperfluous Branches, and twiggs in the middle part, but cut not the utmoſt ſides or top Branches, untill they be ſpread as large as they ſhould ſpread and be ſure to leade the maine, and biggeſt Branches, along the ſides of the wall, both wayes, and ſuffer them not to riſe ſtraight up as naturally they will, but correct nature by art.</p>

               <p>It is a great errour amongſt ſome, who ſuffer all the young,<note place="margin">Errour in Pruning.</note> &amp; large Shoots to grow as much as they will, all <hi>Summer</hi> without cutting, and then in <hi>Winter</hi> they uſually cut all or moſt of them quite off from the trees, and preſerve only the old ſtumps, or biggeſt Branches of the trees, and by this meanes in the middle part of the Tree, and neere the Root, there are few, or no <hi>young Branches,</hi> to be ſeene: Whereas they ſhould preſerve the <hi>young Branches</hi> to ſpread up againſt the wall, untill it be full of ſmall Boughs. And then ſome young Shoots (every yeare) may be cut off in Sommer, as before.</p>
               <p>And in cutting away <hi>Branches,</hi> be ſure to take thoſe away that grow the ſtraighteſt out, and will not ſo eaſily be bowed to the Wall, as the other: And preſerve branches as low, and as neere the ground as may be, and cauſe them to bend, and grow ſtraight along the ſides of the Wall both wayes; and ſuffer not the biggeſt Branches to riſe ſtraight upward, as (com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly moſt doe,) but naile them downwards.</p>

               <p>Alſo to lay <hi>Pigeons dung, Hens dung, Sheeps dung,</hi> to the roots (or the like ſtuffe, that is very <hi>hot,</hi> and <hi>fertill,</hi>) will much help the <hi>Trees,</hi> and make them beare ſtore of fruits; <hi>Vines,</hi> or other <hi>Fruit-trees.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So alſo of <hi>Lees of Wine,</hi> the <hi>waſhing of ſtrong Beere-Barrels, Blood of Cattle, dead Dogges, Carrion,</hi> or the like, laid, or put to the <hi>Roots of Trees,</hi> when opened (as before) is found very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable unto fruit-bearing.</p>

               <p>And further obſerve: That <hi>Mowing of Grounds</hi> yearely, where Fruit-trees grow, is exceeding prejudiciall to Trees in reſpect of bearing (unleſſe the <hi>ſoyle</hi> be exceeding <hi>fertill</hi>) But <hi>paſturing of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chards,</hi> and Grounds where Fruit-trees grow, is obſerved to be of great advantage to their proſpering, and bearing Fruits.

               </p>
               <p>Therfore permit <hi>Cattle</hi> (if it may be convenient) to lye, &amp; pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, under &amp; among Fruit-trees (after they are grown ſtrong, &amp; out of their reach) ſave only at thoſe <hi>ſeaſons</hi> when Fruits are ripe, becauſe rubbing againſt the Trees would ſhake down the fruits, and ſpoil them.

               </p>
               <p>Concerning <hi>Moſſineſſe</hi> of Fruit-trees, the way to cure that (and other <hi>Diſeaſes</hi>) is to take away the Cauſe, <hi>ſublatâ cauſâ,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 <hi>Moſſineſſe.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litur effectus.</hi> If the ſpring be ſtopt, the ſtreames cannot runne. Some to cure this, only ſcrape off the <hi>Moſſe,</hi> not indeavouring to take away the <hi>Cauſe,</hi> ſo that in a few yeares they are as bad a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, that's but like endeavours for cure of the <hi>Tooth-ach,</hi> or <hi>Gout,</hi> or the like, with ſome outward applications (which though they may give ſome eaſe for a while, yet they ſtrike not at the root, they remove not the <hi>Cauſe,</hi> and therefore they returne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. So that it muſt be conſidered what the <hi>Cauſe of Moſſineſſe is,</hi> ſometimes it is <hi>cauſed</hi> by <hi>over coldneſſe</hi> of the ground, as in <hi>wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriſh, and clay grounds,</hi> likewiſe by <hi>Barrenneſſe</hi> of the ſoyle.</p>
               <p>If it be <hi>Coldneſſe</hi> through moyſture, then uſe all means to lay it dryer, by trenching the ground: or if it be <hi>Clay-ground,</hi> then bring in ſome warmer ſoyls to mixe with it, as <hi>Sand, Aſhes, Sheeps-dung, Pigeons, or Hens-dung,</hi> or the like: If the ſoyle be too <hi>bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren,</hi> then help it by mixtures of good ſoyles, round about the Roots.</p>
               <p>But withall take away the <hi>Moſſe</hi> that is already upon the trees, in this manner; after Raine rub it off with a <hi>Haire-cloth:</hi> elſe ſcrape it off with a piece of hard wood in the forme of a knife.</p>
               <p>Another is the <hi>Barke-bound diſeaſe:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 <hi>Bark-bound.</hi>
                  </note> This exceedingly hinders the growth of trees: it makes them live lingringly and poorly: This happens when there is but a dull, and ſlow paſſage up of ſap, and in ſmall quantity, either by reaſon of barrenneſſe of ſoile or want of due culture, to the Branches, therefore if the ſoile be barren it muſt be mended, and likewiſe ſome of the Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches cut off, and the reſt ſcored downe all along
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:130473:47"/> to the Root, through the bark, on each ſide, with ſome croſſe cuts, and nicks in the bark: let this be done in the ſpring time, &amp; the ſap will ariſe more plentifully.</p>

               <p>This is <hi>no good Inſtruction:</hi> for <hi>Orchards on low and plaine grounds</hi> have many advantages of thoſe <hi>on high grounds,</hi> for the ſoyle of plaine, and low grounds is commonly more fertill then <hi>hill tops.</hi> Secondly, <hi>low grounds</hi> are more ſafe from <hi>Winds</hi> then <hi>hills,</hi> by reaſon of other trees planted to ſecure the Orchard, and by <hi>hills, houſes or other ſhelters: hill tops</hi> can have no defence.

               <p>Divers others ſpeake to the like purpoſe.</p>
               <p>Theſe are ſtrange fancies, meerely imaginary things: neither <hi>Reaſon</hi> nor <hi>Experience</hi> dictate any ſuch. They are not only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valid,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:130473:55"/> or of no power at all, to effect what they propoſe, but are alſo <hi>Hurtfull and dangerous</hi> to the Trees, and Grafts; But if they might be done without danger, yet are they not able to worke any ſuch effects as are promiſed, For it is not poſſible ſuch ſmall proportions as they ſpeake of, ſhould communicate and transferre their vertues through all the parts of the huge and vaſt bodies of trees, and to multitudes of Fruits, much leſſe that they ſhould do this for many yeares, and leaſt of all that the Grafts (cut from theſe Trees) ſhould retaine theſe ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, being ſet on other ſtockes.</p>
               <p>May it reaſonably be ſaid, That a Meſſe of ſweete and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant meat, nay only a Bit of ſuch meate given to a Child of ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der yeares, the ſame will retaine the vertues, and ſtrength of ſuch meate, all his life time, yea will transferre the vertues of it to his children after him; when every one knowes the ſtrength and vertue of the beſt meate or drinke (though taken in great quantity) is ſoone over, and ſpent, and that it is a continued daily ſupply, that does uphold and maintaine the body in good ſtate and condition.</p>
               <p>We have no reaſon to believe that the virtues and ſtrength of any daintie diſh will continue ſo long with us, as <hi>Elia's Morſell of meat</hi> did with him, which yet was but fortie daies, and that was a Miracle too: how much leſſe reaſon have we to think it will laſt many yeares.</p>
               <p>Is there not I ſay as much reaſon for this as the other. Admit it were poſſible that a ſmall quantitie of <hi>ſweet ſpices</hi> ſhould tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe &amp; communicate its properties to all the parts of a tree, yet it would not continue long in it, but it muſt be <hi>a continued, and daily ſupply of ſuch ſweet things,</hi> as muſt work that effect, if poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ſuch a thing may be, by any meanes.

               <p>The ſame inſtruction is given by a late Engliſh Author.</p>
               <p>Another ſaies, to have <hi>coloured Peaches, we ſhould colour the kernells within the ſtones, and the fruits will be of the ſame colour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſame Author ſaies, to have <hi>Red Apples, put the Grafts into Pikes blood.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We ſee here their preſcriptions for <hi>rare colour'd fruits,</hi> which are as farre off from <hi>truth or Reaſon,</hi> as the former concerning fruits of an <hi>aromatique or spicy taſte,</hi> for the things are not only dangerous if tryed, but if it were not ſo, yet are weake, and <hi>inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid</hi> towards the working of any ſuch effects. Becauſe <hi>colour</hi> is an <hi>accident,</hi> cleaving to ſome ſubſtance and as the ſubſtance is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, and converted into another body, then it looſeth its <hi>acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents,</hi> which it had before, as <hi>colour, ſhape, &amp;c</hi> as a peece of <hi>cloath, wood,</hi> or the like, being burned, rotten or otherwiſe diſſolved, does looſe its <hi>colour,</hi> or other accidents, that it had before it's change. And <hi>coloured Meats,</hi> eaten and turned into <hi>fleſh, blood, &amp; ſpirits,</hi> looſe their <hi>colours, taſte, &amp;c.</hi> So the juyce of the earth, if it be <hi>white, black browne,</hi> or any other colour, yet when it is drawn by Roots, for inſtance: <hi>Carrots,</hi> then it is turned into a <hi>Yellow, or Reddiſh colour,</hi> or if drawn by <hi>Turnups,</hi> it is then converted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a <hi>white colour,</hi> though it were a quite contrary before.</p>
               <p>So alſo of <hi>Liquors,</hi> (or other things of delicate <hi>colours</hi>) being converted into the ſubſtance of <hi>Trees, Fruits, and Leaves,</hi> they looſe their former <hi>colours,</hi> though never ſo glorious, and beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. And if great quantities of coloured liquors, or other ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances cannot produce coloured fruits, how much more impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible is it that a drop, or two, of any coloured thing ſhould doe it, or only <hi>colouring the kernells</hi> (as he ſpeaks of:) which could not become trees of many yeeres after. It's cleare, that fruits con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the ſubſtances they draw into their own natures, and receive little or no alteration, unleſſe by a conſtant, and continuall ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply from yeare to yeare. Concerning ſetting <hi>Roſe-trees under other Trees, to produce coloured fruits,</hi> it is one of the moſt ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:130473:56"/> conceits that I have read, what is it that ſhould worke the effect: may it be imagined that the Trees can ſee the <hi>Red-Roſes</hi> as <hi>Jacobs ſheep</hi> did the <hi>Rods</hi> in the water,<note place="margin">Gen. 30.37.</note> and ſo bring forth fruits according to the ſame colour, can any man apprehend ſo much as a colour, or ſhadow of a Reaſon for it?</p>
               <p>Another of the <hi>ſecond ſort of Errors</hi> is this:</p>

               </p>
               <p>Were it not a wonderfull ſight to ſee <hi>Wallnuts and all Nuts,</hi> to grow without husks, we know the Nuts of themſelves have no ſtalkes, and how then ſhould they grow upon the Tree with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out huskes to incloſe them. What is it that ſhould worke this ſtrange effect: is it becauſe the kernels are put into the ground without ſhels, and for that the tree ſprings from the kernels on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; Doe not all Trees ſpring from the kernells only, though ſet with their ſhells, the <hi>huſk and ſhell,</hi> contribute nothing at all towards the Tree, they open for the <hi>kernell</hi> to ſpring out, and then rot themſelves.</p>
               <p>Another of this <hi>ſecond ſort is this:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> A late Author gives Inſtructions about early fruits, and late: and chainge of fruits by Grafting he ſaies: <hi>If you graft a late fruit on an early ſtock, the fruit will be early, and if you Graft an Ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fruit upon a late ſtocke, the fruit will be late. As if</hi> ſaith he) <hi>you graft Apples, on Mulbery-trees, you ſhall have fruit all ſommer, even till November. And that if you graft a Plum-tree, on the Nut-tree, the husk will be like the Nut-huſke, but within it will be a Plume. Or if you graft a Plum</hi> (or any other fruit) <hi>on the Fig-tree, the fruit will grow without Bloſſoming.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe things cannot be; for contrary kinds will not grow together, as the <hi>Plum tree and Fig-tree, or Plum-tree, and Nut-tree,</hi> but if different ſorts would agree, and grow together yet theſe effects would not be, becauſe <hi>Grafts doe alwayes rule,

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> Another of the <hi>ſecond ſort of Errors</hi> is this: <hi>Democritus</hi> (as one affirmes) gives an Inſtruction for procuring fruits with <hi>Inſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and ingravings upon them,</hi> in any figure or ſhape.</p>

               </p>
               <p>A late Author ſaies, <hi>Steep the ſtones of Peaches two or three daies and then open them, and with a braſſe pen write on the rind of the ker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nells after put them againe into the ſtones, and wrap them about with paper, or parchment, and plant them, and the fruit will be written, and engraven.</hi> Is not this an odd conceit: that <hi>writing upon the ker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell,</hi> ſhould produce fruits <hi>written or engraven.</hi> A man (no doubt) with as good ſucceſſe may ingrave, or write upon the <hi>ſhell or huske</hi> of an Almond, or other fruit, as upon the <hi>kernell,</hi> or if he will upon the <hi>paper or parchment,</hi> in which it is inwrapt: for the Rind of the Kernell contributes nothing to the <hi>tree or fruit,</hi> but opens (as the Huſke or ſhell) to let out the <hi>inner part of the kernell.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But if a man deſires to have fruits with <hi>inſcriptions and engra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings,</hi> he muſt take another courſe preſcribed by a Learned Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor,<note place="margin">Lo: Bacon, Nat. Hiſt. pag. <hi>128.</hi>

               <p>Concerning the <hi>ſecond ſort of Errors</hi> thus much, it were eaſie to mention many more as idle as theſe, but I ſhall not trouble my ſelfe, nor the Reader with them at preſent: only I ſay in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, let men take heed of ſuch things aſſerted by Authors, as have neither <hi>Reaſon nor Experience</hi> to uphold them, leaſt they ſpend their <hi>money, labour and time</hi> about them, and inſtead of profits and pleaſures, find diſcouragements, and trouble.</p>

The Cauſe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is manifeſt, for that the nouriſhment is better prepared in the ſtocke then in the crude earth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſay herein <hi>theſe Authours aſſigne a wrong Cauſe to an effect: for ſimply Grafting</hi> contributes nothing at all to the early bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of Fruit, nor to its goodneſſe. But the <hi>Cauſe</hi> is <hi>In the Nature of the Grafts:</hi> if they be Grafts cut from <hi>bearing trees,</hi> and of <hi>good kinds,</hi> they beare fruits in a yeare or two, but if they be Grafts from <hi>young unbearing trees coming of ſeed,</hi> ſuch Grafts will not beare the ſooner for <hi>Grafting,</hi> it is not <hi>ſimply grafting,</hi> I ſay, nor the <hi>knot</hi> (as the Authors ſpeake of) that makes trees beare one yeare, one day, the ſooner, for if ſo, then grafts from <hi>young unbearing trees,</hi> coming of ſeed, grafted in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and upon as good ſtocks, as other grafts from <hi>old bearing trees,</hi> they would beare fruits the one ſort as ſoon as the other: but it is otherwiſe: ſo that the <hi>Cauſe</hi> lyes not <hi>ſimply in grafting,</hi> but in the <hi>Nature of the grafts:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Neither does <hi>Grafting</hi> make fruits (at all) the better, otherwiſe then as you chuſe <hi>grafts of a good kind,</hi> for wee know <hi>Grafts rule,</hi> and keepe their owne Natures. And the <hi>Cauſe</hi> is not well aſſign'd by the Author who ſaies: <hi>it is for that the nouriſhment is better prepared in the ſtocke, then in the crude earth:</hi> for we know the <hi>Branches of an ungrafted tree,</hi> receive ſap not immediately from the crude Earth, but from a ſtock or body, as well as the branches of the Grafted tree: the ſtock of the <hi>Grafted tree,</hi> is a wild ſtock, and of the ſame nature, as is the ſtock, or body, of the <hi>ungrafted tree:</hi> they are both alike, and the concoction and nouriſhment
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:130473:58"/> in both, is alike, &amp; the <hi>Cauſe being alike,</hi> why is not the effect alike. Its plaine: this is not the <hi>Cauſe</hi> but the <hi>Cauſe</hi> is in the <hi>Graft</hi> not in the <hi>ſtocke,</hi>

               <p>Another of the <hi>third ſort of Errors,</hi> is this.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> A late Author ſaies: the <hi>Cauſe</hi> why trees beare not fruit in a few yeares after grafting is, <hi>becauſe they were grafted in the old of the Moone: for</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſo many daies as the Moone is old when you graft, ſo many yeares will the Graft be ere it beare fruit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Cauſe is here miſtaken:</hi> for the <hi>Moone</hi> hath no ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence upon fruit-trees, as to withhold their fruits in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: men (we ſee by experience) graft in all ſeaſons of the Moon, and find no ſuch difference in the bearing of the trees: The cheife <hi>Cauſes of unfruitfulneſſe</hi> of trees, are when they are not <hi>fit for the Countrie where they are planted.</hi>

               <p>Many conceive that <hi>ſap in Trees doth deſcend from the Branches to the Rootes, which cauſeth ſeverall effects; as falling of the Leaves, goodneſſe of the Rootes of divers Plants for uſe &amp;c:</hi> but the <hi>Cauſe</hi> of theſe <hi>Effects</hi> is miſtaken, for <hi>Sap</hi> in Trees never <hi>deſcends,</hi> but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies <hi>aſcends,</hi> And <hi>Leaves of Trees fall in Autumne,</hi> not becauſe <hi>ſap deſcends from them,</hi> but becauſe <hi>Sap aſcends not to them</hi> ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to nouriſh, or feed them any longer.</p>
               <p>And if <hi>Rootes are beſt in Autumne,</hi> that is not <hi>Cauſed by deſcent of Sap,</hi> but for that the Body, and Branches of a Tree <hi>in Autum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne,</hi> draw but a ſmall quantity of Sap from the Rootes, and the Rootes <hi>even then</hi> draw ſap for the Earth, and increaſe upon it, and are well ſtored with ſap after the Branches haue done increaſing: and there the ſap reſts cheifely, <hi>at that ſeaſon.</hi>

<pb n="91" facs="tcp:130473:58"/> are removed <hi>in Autumne.</hi> Its true: The Roots of Plants ſet <hi>in the beginning of September</hi> (or about that time) doe ſpring forth a little at the cut ends of the Rootes, before winter, <hi>not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Sap deſcends from the Branches to them,</hi> for though all the Branches are cut off before ſetting, (as ſometimes they are,) yet the Rootes will ſpring <hi>then,</hi> becauſe ſome degree of heate (pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable to that purpoſe) is, <hi>at that ſeaſon, in</hi> the top of the earth by reaſon of the immediate fore-going ſummer, ſoe that Plants ſet while this heat laſteth, they will germinate, and ſpring forth in their Rootes before winter: (the husbandman knowes in this <hi>ſeaſon,</hi> it is beſt to ſow his <hi>Wheate and Rye:</hi>) And alſo becauſe the Sunne (as yet) hath an influence ſufficient to make ſeeds, and Roots of Plants to ſpring forth, which towards <hi>December</hi> it hath not, being then too remote from us, ſoe that it is not <hi>deſcending of Sap</hi> that <hi>Cauſeth</hi> theſe effects.</p>
               <p>The learned <hi>Lord Bacon</hi> did not well conſider this poynt, who ſuppoſed <hi>a deſcention of ſap in Autumne,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Nat: hiſt. p. 111. and 94.</note> ſpeaking concerning ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a Bough in the ground prepared by disbarking for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, ſaies, <hi>the Cauſe why it will ſoone after be a faire Tree, may be this, the baring of the Bark keepeth the ſap from deſcending towards winter:</hi> here's <hi>a wrong Cauſe aſſigned to an effect,</hi> for it is not the ſuppoſed keeping up of the <hi>Sap</hi> (by that meanes he ſpeaks of) that <hi>Cauſeth</hi> ſuch a Bough to grow the better, but the cauſe is for that ſuch a Bough, by disbarking, hath got ſome ſmall Roots, or ſtrings, (or at leaſt ſome roughneſſe or knobs capable of Rootes,) in the paſſage up of the ſap, whereby (being ſet) it will become a Tree in certaine yeares.</p>
               <p>This Opinion of <hi>deſcention of ſap in Trees</hi> is an old <hi>Error,</hi> of many yeares ſtanding, and is radicated in the Minds of moſt men, many uſing it as a <hi>Similitude</hi> to illuſtrate ſome ſpirituall thing, as if it were a reall, and undoubted truth, whereas it is but a weake, and groundleſſe conceipt, and contrary to <hi>Reaſon and experience.</hi> I will therefore lay it open more plainly and prove, and demonſtrate the Truth concerning the <hi>motion of ſap in Trees.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sap in trees allwaies moves upwards,</hi> and it is contrary to the Law, and courſe of nature for <hi>ſap to deſcend, Natura nil agit fruſtra,</hi> nature does nothing in vaine: Now it were a vaine worke in Nature to cauſe <hi>Sap to aſcend, up into the Branches,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:130473:59"/> to deſcend againe to the roots,</hi> the Roots ſend ſap to the Branches, and not the Branches to the Roots, when it once comes into the Branches, it is converted into <hi>Wood, Barke, Leaves, Fruits, &amp;c,</hi> Whence is all that great <hi>Bulk, and body,</hi> which we ſee a Tree a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe to in a few years; if <hi>ſap</hi> ſhould <hi>deſcend</hi> one while, as it <hi>aſcends</hi> another, it would follow, that as a Tree increaſeth by <hi>aſcenſion of ſap,</hi> ſo it would <hi>decreaſe by its deſcenſion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This may be more cleare if we conſider the <hi>Cauſe</hi> why <hi>ſap in Trees ſtirres, &amp; aſcends,</hi> &amp; alſo why it riſeth not after ſuch a time to make any grouth. When the ſunne in the ſpring of the yeare by degrees drawes nearer to us, then <hi>ſap in Trees</hi> begins (by its heat, and influence) to move, to ſwell, and open the Buds, and to cauſe the Branches to ſhoot forth, which increaſe by it all the ſummer: and as the ſunne (by degrees) drawes nearer, and grows hotter, ſo the <hi>ſap</hi> (by degrees) increaſeth, and riſeth more plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, and when the ſunne is neareſt, then Trees are fulleſt of <hi>ſap,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now obſerve: As by the vicinity, and neerneſſe of the ſunne (which is by degrees) the <hi>ſap</hi> is increaſed by degrees, ſo likewiſe, by the ſunnes remoteneſſe, and abſence (which is alſo by degrees) in his going back againe, the <hi>ſap</hi> is alſo diminiſhed by degrees, that is; <hi>aſcending</hi> leſſe and leſſe in quantity, untill the ſunne be gone ſo farre from us, and the heat, and influence of it be ſo weake, that it works not to cauſe <hi>ſap</hi> to riſe up whereby the bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches may increaſe any longer, and then the Branches, and Buds of Trees are all at a ſtand, and grow no more, untill the next ſpring. And at that time the Leaves looſe their beauty, and fall off, becauſe <hi>ſap riſeth not up to them ſufficient to feed them any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,</hi> but only ſo much as to preſerve life in the Tree I would faine know (of thoſe who hold <hi>deſcenſion of ſap</hi>) what ſhould <hi>cauſe it deſcend,</hi> for, <hi>Nullus effectus datur ſine cauſa:</hi> there can be no <hi>effect</hi> without a <hi>cauſe,</hi> they cannot ſay that as <hi>heat cauſeth it aſcend,</hi> ſo <hi>cold cauſeth it deſcend. Cold</hi> never <hi>cauſeth ſap</hi> to ſtir, but to ſtand, or move ſlowly. <hi>Cold</hi> is of a condenſing nature, and does conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate, and fix, rare and fluid bodies: but if <hi>ſap</hi> of its owne nature would deſcend, yet there is none in the Branches <hi>at that ſeaſon of the yeare,</hi> that they can ſpare, but all that has <hi>aſcended</hi> in the ſommer is converted into the ſubſtance of the <hi>Tree, its Leaves, and fruits.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And further: To prove this more fully, and clearely, by a
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:130473:59"/> plaine undeniable Argument. <hi>If there be a continuall aſcenſion of ſap, then there is no deſcenſion, but there is a continuall aſcenſion, therefore no deſcenſion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To prove the <hi>Minor Propoſition: That there is a continuall aſcenſion of ſap in Trees.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Sunne and Ayre continually draw <hi>ſap,</hi> and moiſture out out of Trees, and other <hi>Vegetables,</hi> as the <hi>Lord Bacon</hi> and others conclude, and as may be made appeare by <hi>Reaſon and Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence:</hi> We know, if Branches and Twigs of Trees, being cut off, and laid aſide in the ſunne, and ayre but for a few daies, they will be contracted, and wrinkled, the ayre drawes out the ſap and moiſture, and ſuch having no ſupply of ſap from the Root, they quickly wither. Now know alſo; that the ſunne, and ayre have the ſame operation upon the <hi>living Branches and Twiggs;</hi> drawing ſap, and moiſture out of them likewiſe, but they are not contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted and wrinkled as the other, becauſe there is a continuall ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply of <hi>ſap</hi> from the Root, aſwell <hi>in winter,</hi> as <hi>in ſommer:</hi> which keeps them in their full dimenſions without wrinkling, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting.</p>
               <p>Further obſerve: to prove this. If we remove <hi>Plants in Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember,</hi> or about that time (the pretended ſeaſon of <hi>deſcenſion of ſap</hi>) and let them lye out of the earth a day or two, we ſhall finde, that the ſunne and ayre will (in that ſhort time) have ſuckt, and drawne out <hi>ſap and moiſture</hi> from the Branches, ſo that they will be apparently ſhrunke, and contracted. (I have ſeene ſome Branches ſo much wrinkled, that I queſtioned whether they were dead, or alive.) But after the Plants have beene ſet certaine daies, <hi>ſo much ſap will be aſcended</hi> as will againe have fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led up the wrinkled, or contracted bark, ſo that it is evident and apparent hereby, that ſome ſmall quantity of <hi>ſap</hi> hath <hi>aſcended</hi> into the branches ſince their ſetting, and if ſo, then its cleare there's no <hi>deſcenſion of ſap,</hi> can any thing move contrary waies at one time? And if we graft <hi>in November and December</hi> (the very dead time of winter) the grafts have ſome ſmall ſupply of ſap even then, elſe the ſunne and ayre would ſpoyle them, by dayly ſucking out their moiſture, were there not a ſupply of <hi>ſap</hi> from the Root, ſufficient to keep them alive untill the ſpring. Its ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt then from what hath been ſaid, that ſap in Trees <hi>aſcends as well in Autumne, and Winter, as in Sommer,</hi> ſo much as to preſerve
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:130473:60"/> life in Trees, by ſupplying what is extracted by the <hi>Sunne and Ayre:</hi> ſo that it may be concluded there is no <hi>deſcenſion of ſap;</hi> unleſſe men will hold that a thing may move ſeverall waies, <hi>up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and downwards,</hi> at one and the ſame time, which is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction, and impoſſible in nature.</p>
               <p>Thus much concerning the <hi>three ſorts of Errors in the Theory of this Art.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt: <hi>Inſtructions hurtfull, and dangerous.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly: <hi>Inſtructions for effecting ſome things impoſſible to be effected by the meanes preſcribed, and others impoſſible to be effected by any meanes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly: <hi>Aſſigning wrong Cauſes to effects.</hi>

                  <head>I will now diſcover ſome <hi>Errors</hi> that I finde <hi>in the practiſe of this Art of Planting Fruit-trees,</hi> that they may be avoided.</head>
                  <p>ONE <hi>Error in Practiſe</hi> is this: Many <hi>remove their Trees in winter,</hi>
                     <note place="margin" type="runSum">
                        <hi>1</hi> Removing trees in win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</note> 
                     <hi>or neere the ſpring,</hi> whereas they ought to remove them in <hi>September,</hi> or thereabouts. Many Plants are ready to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move in the beginning of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> and before, which if done, ſuch have a great advantage of thoſe removed in winter or neere the ſpring, for trees removed betimes in the yeare, grow in their Roots before winter, and ſo make a faire preparation againſt the ſpring: And this is a <hi>Generall Rule,</hi> for Tranſplanting all trees. <hi>To remove ſo ſoone as they have done growing in the branches,</hi> which may be knowne by the top, or ends of the branches, if the tops be cloſed and ſhut up, they may be removed without danger, though it be in <hi>Auguſt,</hi> or before, which is no ſmall advantage to them. See pag. 60.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin" type="runSum">
                        <hi>2</hi> Planting trees too neer together.</note>Another <hi>Error in Practiſe,</hi> is <hi>Planting trees too neere together:</hi> This is a great and generall <hi>Error,</hi> many thinke, the more Trees they have, the more fruit: but a few having roome enough to ſpread will beare more fruits then many, crouded one upon an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other as the cuſtome is, and fruits will alſo be better when the ſun may come round about the trees. I account 10 or 12 yards a competent diſtance for <hi>Apple-trees and Peare-trees,</hi> upon ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſoyle, but if the ground be ſpeciall good, then give them the more roome: for <hi>Cherry-trees, Plum-trees</hi> and ſuch like, 7 or 8 yards is a convenient diſtance.</p>

                        <hi>3</hi> Planting trees unfit for the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey.</note>Another <hi>Error</hi> is this: Many <hi>Plant Fruit-trees unfit for the Countrey</hi> where they plant them, Their care is chiefly to chuſe Grafts of the beſt kinds and faire Plants to look upon, not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering ſo much, whether ſuch kindes will proſper, and beare fruits well in thoſe <hi>Clymates,</hi> and places where they plant them. And hence it is often, that many who have faire and goodly fruit trees, have very little fruit from them. It is an excellent Rule to chuſe thoſe kindes of fruits, which we (or others) finde by many yeares experience, to be good bearing trees, in thoſe parts neereſt to us: although the fruits be not altogether ſo good as ſome others.</p>
